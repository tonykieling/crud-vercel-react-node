# CRUD.js app  

This app demonstrates the basic principles of a system that handles data.

The bottom line, the app has Backend and Frontend parts.  

-- **Backend:**
* It receives the client' requests and integrates with the DB which runs on the cloud (MongoDB Atlas).
* Inserts new items onto the DB (Create)
* Queries the DB about data already recorded (Retrieve)
* Updates data sent by the user (Update)
* Remove items (Delete)  
That means **C**reate, **R**etrieve, **U**pdate, and **D**elete (CRUD).  
*ps. The server was developed and it is running based on serverless computing architecture, where each client's request runs a function on the server without any resource's pre-allocation.*

-- **Frontend**
* Besides the graphic experience, it also plays the role of doing some data validation that would cost to the backend processing time and computing effort.


-- **Tech Stack** includes Node, React, MongoDB Atlas, CSS, HTML, and Mongoose.
