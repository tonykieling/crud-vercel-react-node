this file,
[queryInput].js, and
./code

do not affect the current app.

the last 2 are related to a specific test, regarding path segment.


A valid trategy is:
1- directory api
2- a api/index.js which is a main entrance for the apis in general doing a switch/case
3- having the directories according with their subject. i.e. product, client and the action files are there and called by index.js
 - [queryInput].js also can be a general entrance which will will receive from /api/test and have a variable called queryInput coming from req.query.queryInput. After that, can chech whether there are body aor other flags to send for the correct function.

Still remains an issue:
- when pressing enter or f5 in the browser, the request it is not anymore for the app, but browser will send to vercel.
  that means, it only works for the home page, i.e. localhost:3000
